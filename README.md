about me page with bootstrap

<!-- Thank you for submitting your assignment. It appears that you have a decent layout started for your Portfolio site, but it lacks most all of the necessary functionality. Of the required links, the only one that appears to work is to your GitHub Profile. Though when getting there, there are still many requirements that need implementing within. Other links that are present but do not work are for your PDF version of your Resume and a link to both your Deployed Site and GitHub Repository for each of your projects. Additionally you are missing a link all together for your LinkedIn, which has its own set of requirements. For a full list of all requirements please refer to the README for this assignment. -->
